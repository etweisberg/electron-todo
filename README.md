# Simple Electron To Do List

In this educational project I attempted to learn how to make a desktop application with web technologies using ElectronJS. 
It includes a basic form to add items and due dates and use a checkbox to visually mark items as done. There is also a menu option to clear items. The app can be built for linux as a .deb software package.
